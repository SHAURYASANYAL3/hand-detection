# 🖐️ Cool Hand HUD

**Cool Hand HUD** is a browser-based interactive demo that uses [MediaPipe HandLandmarker](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker) to track your hands in real-time using your webcam.  
It overlays a futuristic **heads-up display (HUD)** and animated visual effects directly on top of your hand landmarks, creating a **sci-fi, AR-like experience** — all running locally in your browser.
